<b>Trapped!</b>

Created by: Kevin Zhang and Frankie Liu

You "wake up" in a room filled with a bunch of colorful Dr. Seuss trees. The only way to escape this horrible nightmare is to shoot and blow all the enemies floating around... Little did you know that this is just the beginning of a long and epic journey...
<br>
Basically in this game you control the camera using your mouse movements, and control the person moving using the keyboard.
Pressing MOUSE1 will fire a ball in the center of your screen and if that bullet hits an enemy in the scene, the enemy will blow up!
