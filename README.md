<b>Trapped!</b>

Created by: Kevin Zhang and Frankie Liu

This is a shooting game occurs in a room, where a person has to shoot different boxes  that are floating around in a scene. They have a gun and the more boxes they destroy, the more points they get. They can freely walk and look around the scene.

The main 3 features we are implementing are:
1. L-system plant generation
2. Collision detection with bounding boxes and spheres
3. Particle effects.

Some future features we want to implement if we have time:
1. Scoring system
2. Better shaped trees
3. Smoother movements
4. Physics fun!

Written using C++ with OpenGL.
